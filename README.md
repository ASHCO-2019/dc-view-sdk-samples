# Getting started with the Adobe Document Cloud View SDK

The Adobe Document Cloud View SDK lets you display PDF files in your website and leverage its power to benefit your users.

## Prerequisites

Before you can work with the SDK, you must register your application and get Client Id (API Key). For details, see the "Registering Your Application" section of this guide.

## Supported Platforms

1. Windows - Chrome 77+, Firefox 69+, Edge 42+, IE11+
2. Mac - Chrome 77+, Firefox 69+, Safari 12+

## Registering Your Application

[Request Access](https://www.adobe.io/apis/documentcloud/dcsdk/form.html) to get your own Client Id and Credentials.

## Running the samples

The following sub-sections describe how to run the samples.

### PDF Preview

A sample PDF file preview will be rendered using the SDK. To see it in action, copy the files under ```default-view``` folder to your computer, and open index.html in a supported browser.

### PDF Preview with Annotation tools

A sample PDF file preview will be rendered using the SDK, along with annotation tools enabled. To see it in action, copy the files under ```annotations-with-save``` folder to your computer, and open index.html in a supported browser.

Note that by default if a user saves the PDF file after adding comments, the file is downloaded locally. This sample shows how to change that behavior, in this case taking no action except adding a small delay.
